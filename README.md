An initial NixOS system configuration for my Lenovo Legion Y740. 

Note this does not contain much user configuration as I use home-manager for that.
(A separate repo.)

I switch between Hyprland and KDE sessions.

```
$ lspci | grep VGA

01:00.0 VGA compatible controller: NVIDIA Corporation TU104BM [GeForce RTX 2080 Mobile] (rev a1)
```
